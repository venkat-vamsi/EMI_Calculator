    <h2>What is EMI?</h2>
    <p>
      Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is the fixed amount payable every month to a bank or financial institution until the loan is fully repaid. It includes both the interest and a portion of the principal amount. While the EMI remains constant, the share of interest and principal changes over time — with interest being higher in the initial months and gradually reducing as the loan progresses.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>EMI Formula:</strong><br>
      <em>E = P × r × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> / ((1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1)</em><br><br>
      Where:<br>
      P = Principal Loan Amount<br>
      r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)<br>
      n = Loan Tenure in Months
    </div>

    <p>
      For example, if you borrow ₹10,00,000 at 10.5% annual interest for 10 years (120 months), your EMI will be ₹13,493. Over the loan term, you will repay ₹16,19,220 in total, including ₹6,19,220 as interest.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does the EMI Calculator Work?</h2>
    <p>
      Our EMI Calculator simplifies complex calculations and provides instant results with colorful charts and tables. You can calculate EMI for home loans, car loans, personal loans, education loans, or any other fully amortizing loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just enter the loan amount, tenure, and interest rate. The calculator will display:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly EMI amount</li>
      <li>Breakdown of principal vs. interest</li>
      <li>Yearly and monthly payment schedules</li>
      <li>Outstanding balance after each year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With interactive charts and tables, you can easily visualize how your loan repayments progress over time. You can also explore prepayment options to reduce interest outgo and shorten your loan tenure.
